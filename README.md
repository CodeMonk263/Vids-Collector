Instructions on using the app ->

The backend api can be used to get a fresh list of videos by clicking Change Page button and entering the page number to get videos from. Once api call is done, you are returned with a "Success" message which means api call has been successfully completed. Now simply come back to home page, refresh it and you will be welcomed with your requested page and its videos.

If you want to stream a video just use click on the WATCH button and u will be redirected to an api call which will fetch the final video link for you by using selenium. Wait for some time and once the video is fetched the src field will be something other than "None".

Once that happens just return back to the home page and refresh it. After that the video of your choice will have its background changed to blue and ready to watch. Just click on the WATCH button again.
